										<h3>How often should I attend a class to achieve results?</h3>
										<p>By attending two classes per week you can significantly increase strength and flexibility and feel overall body tone.

										<p>Depending on fitness and background some clients may be able to start on Barre Attack.  There is no rule on the number of other barre classes you need to attend before moving up to this class type. To be sure it is best to ask Amie Energy for guidance.</p>
